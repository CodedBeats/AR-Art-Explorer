# AR Art Explorer

![Project Logo](assets/Images/ar_art_explorer_logo.png)

**AR Art Explorer** is an augmented reality (AR) app that allows you to view beautiful personally scanned 3D models when you view certain paintings.

## Description

A simple AR app that shows hand scanned 3D models that relate to pieces of art around my house.

The project was built using the **8th Wall** AR development platform. Due to workspace access restrictions tied to my university subject, I will no longer be able to make updates or edits once the class concludes.
